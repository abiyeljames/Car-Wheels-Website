## A description of how I achieved my responsive layout using CSS Grid layout
For my reference, at first, I have made research about what is CSS grid layout and how can I make a responsive layout by using CSS Grid layout. For my research I have used the internet as my main source of information, referred to some of the CSS Grid layout website making videos and I have collected every possible information by using different websites available to me. Then, I have followed various steps that are mentioned in one of the websites such as setting up the markup, writing base styles, setting up the grid, setting up the browser compatibility, styling the items inside the grid and lastly, by placing the items on the grid to achieve the task.

## A description of how I used Flexbox in my navbar
For using the Flexbox in my navigation bar first I set up the layout for the mobile, tablet and Desktop and then I added Flexbox styles with the mobile layout, tablet layout and Desktop layout. I have gone through the concepts of navbar’s basic responsiveness and that helped me to implement it in my website, then I have gone through the concepts of flexbox’s ordering, aligning, and sizing properties so that I can build navigation bars that adapts to their layouts to the viewport size. This is how I used Flexbox in my navbar.
